<H2>MT_DELAUNAY: MT contructors</H2>

<P>
MT_DELAUNAY is a set of programs dealing with (constrained) Delaunay triangulations
of terrain data (triangulation in the plane with elevations associated 
with vertices).
</P>

<P>
They can be used to build a triangulation with a set of points,
to simplify an existing triangulation by removing a subset of the points,
and they can also be used to build an MT during this process.
</P>

<P>The version for constrained triangulation has not been extensively
checked.</P>
