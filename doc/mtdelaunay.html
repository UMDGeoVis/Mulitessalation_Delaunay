<H2>Terrain triangulation and construction of a Multi-Triangulation</H2>

<B>MT Delaunay</B> allows
the construction of MTs for
terrains (two-dimensional scalar fields) based on a 
<!-- (constrained) -->
Delaunay triangulation of the plane domain of the terrain.
<P>

MT Delaunay includes a number of programs implementing
different techniques for the 
construction and iterative modification of Delaunay triangulations
<!-- and constrained Delaunay triangulation --> 
through vertex insertion or vertex removal.
As a side effect, the program builds an MT from the sequence of local
modifications performed.
</P>

<H3>Programs within MT Delaunay</H3>

<P>
<B>MT Delaunay</B> contains <!-- six --> three programs, corresponding to
the following approaches:
<OL>
<LI>
 <B>RefDel / MtRefDel</B> -- 
 Construction of a Delaunay triangulation starting from a set of points
 through iterative vertex insertion / and production of an MT.
<!--
<LI>
 <B>RefCDT</B> --
 Construction of a constrained Delaunay triangulation starting from a set 
 of points and line segments. This functionality is just meant to provide
 an input file for the algorithms based on vertex removal 
 (see point 4 below), and does not produce an MT.
-->
<LI>
 <B>DecDel / MtDecDel</B> --
 Decimation of a Delaunay triangulation through iterative vertex removal
 (by removing one vertex at a time) / and production of an MT.
<LI>
 <B>SiDecDel / MtSiDecDel</B> --
 Decimation of a Delaunay triangulation through iterative vertex removal,
 (by removing a removing a set of independent vertices at a time,
 i.e., a maximal set of vertices which can be 
 removed simultaneously without interfering) /
 and production of an MT.
<!--
<LI>
 <B>DecCDT / MtDecCDT</B> --
 Decimation of a constrained Delaunay triangulation through iterative 
 vertex removal
 (by removing one vertex at a time) / and production of an MT.
<LI>
 <B>SiDecCDT / MtSiDecCDT</B> --
 Decimation of a constrained Delaunay triangulation through iterative
 vertex removal 
 (by removing a removing a set of independent vertices at a time,
 i.e., a maximal set of vertices which can be
 removed simultaneously without interfering) / and production of an MT.
-->
</OL>

<P>
<!--
Each program, with the exception of RefCDT, can be compiled in two versions:
-->
Each program can be compiled in two versions:
<UL>
<LI>the version named with the "Mt" prefix builds an MT as a side effect
<LI>the other one just builds the final (refined or coarsened) triangulation.
</UL>
</P>

<P>
The MT is produced together with the approximation errors of its triangles.
<BR>

The <B>approximation error of a triangle</B> 
<I>t</I> is evaluated as the 
maximum vertical distance between a point (not vertex of the triangulation),
whose vertical projection falls inside or on the boundary of <I>t</I>,
and the plane of <I>t</I>.
</P>

<P>
Vertices can be inserted / removed either in a
random order, or selected according to heuristic criteria which try to 
achieve the least approximation error for a given number of triangles in
the current representation.
<BR>
In the latter case, the next point to be inserted is the one that is likely
to decrease the approximation error as quickly as possible, and the the next
point to be removed is the one that is likely to increase the approximation
error as slowly as possible.
</P>

<P>
In all algorithms, 
the iterative process may stop either when a given number of the
available vertices has been inserted / removed, or when the approximation
error of the current model reaches a certain global approximation error.
</P>

<P>
The above functionalities are documented in the paper:

<H3>How to compile the programs</H3>

<P>
Two makefiles are provided:
<OL>
<LI><TT>mtmake</TT> compiles the programs to refine
    or coarsen a triangulation and build an MT as a side effect
    (program names with the "Mt" prefix)
<LI><TT>simpmake</TT> compiles the programs just to refine
    or coarsen a triangulation, without building 
    an MT as a side effect
    (program names without the "Mt" prefix)
</OL>
In the first case, you need the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.disi.unige.it/person/MagilloP/MT_SW/MT/doc/index.html">
MT library</A> to compile and run the programs.
</P>

<P>
Check that the compiler and options contained in the appropriate
makefile match the ones of your system;
edit the file if necessary.
</P>

<P>
To compile all programs in the version
which produces an MT, type:
<BR>
<TT>make -f mtmake all</TT> 
</P>

To compile all programs in the version which does not produce an MT, type:
<BR>
<TT>make -f simpmake all</TT>
</P>

<P>You can also make each target separately.</P>

<P>
<B>Remark:</B> if you compile both versions, remember to remove all the
".o" files between compiling the second time with a different makefile.
</P>

<H3>How to run the programs</H3>

<P>
For all of the <!-- six --> three programs,
you can run the program from the command line by typing
(assuming that PROG is the name of the chosen program):
<UL>
<TT>./PROG InFile OutFile [format string]</TT>
</UL>
where
<UL>
<LI><TT>InFile</TT> is the input file
<LI><TT>OutFile</TT> is the output file
(it will contain the final refined or coarsened triangulation)
<LI><TT>format string</TT> (optional) contains the parameters 
for the algorithm.
</UL>
</P>

<P>
For algorithms based on vertex insertion (PROG = RefDel),
<!--  or RefCDT), -->
the input file 
contains a set of points.
<!--  and, possibly, a set of straight-line segments. -->
<BR>
For algorithms based on vertex removal (PROG = DecDel, SiDecDel),
<!-- , DecCDT, SiDecCDT), -->
it contains a <!-- possibly constrained --> Delaunay triangulation.
</P>

<P>
The output file will contain the final triangulation resulting from
applying the given algorithm to the input data, with the
parameters that the user will give.
</P>

<P>
For a description of the format of point and triangulation files,
see <A HREF="#FORMATS">file formats</A>).
<P>

<H3>Parameters and the format string</H3>

<P>
Parameters may be provided to the algorithm by command line
(through the <B>format string</B>), or <B>interactively</B>.
</P>

<P>
The format string contains the following parameter specifications, in
this order:
<OL>
<LI><P>
One letter defining the <B>criterion for selecting the next vertex</B> 
to be processed
(or the next vertex set, in case of simultaneous decimation):
<UL>
<LI>
 <TT>e</TT>: Error-driven selection.
<LI>
 <TT>r</TT>: Random selection.
</UL>
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
Only for programs based on decimation, if the selected criterion is
error-driven: one letter defining the <B>mode of 
estimation of the error increase</B> caused by removing a vertex:
<UL>
<LI>
 <TT>a</TT>: Use a (faster) approximate estimation.
<LI>
 <TT>e</TT>: Use a (slower) precise estimation.
</UL>
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
Only for programs based on decimation: one number
defining the <B>maximum degree for a removable vertex</B>:
<UL>
<LI>
 0: Vertices of any degree can be removed.
<LI>
 N: (with N&gt;0 integer) Only vertices of degree at most N can be removed.
</UL>
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
One letter, possibly followed by other elements, 
defining <B>when the process must terminate</B>:
<UL>
<LI>
 <TT>u</TT> N: (with N&gt;0 an integer) Stop after N updates 
 (i.e., when N vertices have been inserted,
 or removed (e.g., <TT>u 100</TT> inserts / removes 100 vertices).
<LI>
 <TT>a</TT>: Stop after all possible updates have been 
 performed, i.e., when all points have been inserted, or
 all removable vertices have been removed 
 (vertices defining the corners of the domain, 
 and vertices with a degree over the maximum, are not removable).
<LI>
 <TT>e</TT> N V: (with V&gt;=0 a real number and N a letter)
 Stop when the approximation error of the current triangulation
 reaches the value V. Letter N specifies how
 to compute the global error of the triangulation, and can be one of:
 <BR>
 x: maximum error over all triangles;
 <BR>
 s: mean error over all triangles;
 <BR>
 q: mean of squared triangle errors.
</UL>
</P></LI>
<!--
<LI><P>
Only for programs decimating a constrained triangulation:
one letter specifying if the user wants to <B>change the default
treatment of some situations</B>:
<UL>
<LI>
 <TT>n</TT>: The user will use the default parameters.
<LI>
 <TT>s</TT>: The user will redefine the default
 parameters. In this case, the options is followed by three flags.
 Each can be set either to <TT>s</TT> or to <TT>n</TT> (default = n):
 <BR>
   First flag: if <TT>s</TT>, enables extension of optimization (slower,
   but produces triangulations of better quality).
 <BR>
   Second flag: if <TT>s</TT>, allows the elimination of points in which
   exactly one constraint is incident (endpoints of open chains of
   constraint edges).
 <BR>
   Third flag: if <TT>s</TT>, allows breaking closed chains of constraint
   edges.
</UL>
-->
</OL>
</P>

<P>
If the format string is missing from the command line, the program will
prompt the user and ask for the parameters interactively
(for each parameter, a short explanation is provided).
</P>

<TT>./SiDecDel input.tri output.tri r 0 e x 10.0</TT><BR>
Decimate a triangulation by removing sets of independents
points simultaneously (program SiDecDel).
Points to be removed are chosen randomly (<TT>r</TT>).
No restrictions on the degree of removed vertices (<TT>0</TT>).
The process stops when the approximation error, computed as the maximum
error over all triangles, reaches the value 10.0 (<TT>e x 10.0</TT>).
</P>

<!--
<P>
<TT>./DecCDT input.cdt output.cdt e a 10 u 1000 n</TT><BR>
Decimate a constrained triangulation (program DecCDT).
All settings are as in the first example.

The process stops when 2000 points have been removed (<TT>u 2000</TT>).
The specific settings for CDT decimation are modified

extension of optimization and removal of vertices with exactly one
incident constraint (<TT>s s</TT>), do not enable simplification
of closed chains of constraints (<TT>n</TT>).

<A NAME="CDT"></A>

<H3>Decimation of a constrained Delaunay triangulation</H3>

<P>
It is often desirable to maintain certain known lineal features of a terrain
(e.g., rivers, ridges, isolines, etc.) in such a way that they are
represented at different resolutions in the MT.
</P>

<P>
Algorithm DecCDT builds a terrain MT that incorporates lineal features at
multiple resolutions.
This is done by iterative removal of vertices and simplification of the
polylines forming the features, in the following way:
<UL>
<LI>
  Vertices that are not endpoints of any feature edge are treated
  as in the standard case.
<LI>
  Vertices that are endpoints of three or more feature edges are
  not removed.
<LI>
  Vertices that are endpoints of exactly two feature edges, if selected for
  removal, cause the removal of the two feature edges and their replacement
  with a new feature edge joining the surviving endpoints of the two
  disappearing feature edges (a polyline is simplified by merging two
  consecutive segments into one segment).
<LI>
  Vertices that are endpoints of exactly one feature edge by default
  cannot be removed. One can enable their removal through a command-line
  option. In this case, if selected for removal, 
  they cause the removal of the feature edge incident in them (a
  polyline is shortened).
</UL>

<IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="GIF/deccdt.gif" ><BR>

In the current implementation, the horizontal error caused by the 
approximation of the lineal features with coarser and coarser polylines 
is not evaluated.
In future releases, we plan to evaluate such error and use it for driving
the selection of points to be removed.
</P>
-->

<H3>Conversion utilities</H3>

<P>
Data for a terrain can be:
<OL>
<LI>a set of scattered points (and segments)
<LI>a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN)
<LI>a grid of points
</OL>

In case 1 a refinement algorithm can be applied directly.
In order to apply a decimation algorithm first use a refinement
algorithm to build a triangulation containing all the given points.
<!-- (and segments). -->
</P>

<P>
In case 2 a decimation algorithm can be applied directly.  
In order to apply a refinement algorithm, just forget the
existing triangles and reduce to a set of points.
</P>

<P>
Case 3 can be considered as a subcase of A or as a subcase of B, since
it is straightforward to abtain a regular triangulation of the grid.
A grid file usually contains just the height of the data points.
Since the programs in MT Delaunay 
need the x-y coordinates as well (they assumes to deal with
scattered points) a conversion utility is provided.
Another conversion utility produces x-y coordinates aa well as the triangles
of a regular triangulation of the grid.
</P>

<P>
The two utility programs are:
<UL>
<LI>grid2pts.c  given a grid, produce a point file
<LI>grid2tri.c  given a grid, produce a triangulation file
</UL>

The resulting files can be processed by the programs within MT Delaunay.
